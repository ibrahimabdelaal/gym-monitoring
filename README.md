## Side Project:  AI Gym Workout Monitoring


This project aims to develop a modular workout tracking system utilizing YOLO for pose estimation. The initial focus is on building a solid foundation. Future enhancements will include:

Real-time error detection: Providing instant feedback on exercise form with clear explanations for corrections.
Expanded exercise library: Enabling easy integration of new exercises through a user-friendly interface.
Improved accuracy: Continuously refining the pose detection model to ensure accurate tracking.
